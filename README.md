 ### I learned from this paragraph that programmers should develop their mindset through the most important points mentioned in the paragraph:

1.	Conceiving The Purpose of Software:
2.	The programmer must know the goal of the program in order for the program to work correctly and in an excellent manner in order for people to use the program and benefit from it
3.	The Goals of Software Design:
To construct systems that are as simple to create and maintain for their developers as feasible, allowing them to be and remain as helpful as possible. Code Simplicity's Max Kanat-Alexander
In this case, two things are crucial: You should find your design simple to use and beneficial to others.

4.	 Simplicity: 
When the programmer is working, the programmer must be simple in his work by not complicating the code, and this increases the performance of the program wonderfully
5.	 Solving Problems:
The programmer must be able to understand the problem and solve it correctly, and to train himself to solve problems, and this raises his level in solving any problem that is faced
6.	 Testing:
We must test the code if there is any error and fix it in order for the program to work correctly. This point is very important to prolong the work of the program in the long term
